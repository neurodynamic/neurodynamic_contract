##Summary:

I will always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your goals, but sometimes it is best to have a few simple things written down so that we both know what is what, who should do what and what happens if stuff goes wrong. In this contract you won't find complicated legal terms or large passages of unreadable text. I have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. I do want what's best for the safety of both parties, now and in the future.

####In short:

You ([CLIENT COMPANY]) are hiring me ([MY COMPANY]) to [PROJECT NAME OR DESCRIPTION] for the price of [TOTAL] as outlined in our previous correspondence. Of course it's a little more complicated, but we'll get to that.

##What do both parties agree to do?

As our customer, you have the power and ability to enter into this contract on behalf of your company or organization. You agree to provide me with everything that I need to complete the project including text, images and other information as and when I need it, and in the format that I ask for. You agree to review my work, provide feedback, and sign-off approval in a timely manner. Deadlines work two ways and you will also be bound by any dates that we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out.

I have the experience and ability to perform the services you need from me and I will carry them out in a professional and timely manner. Along the way I will endeavor to meet all the deadlines set but I can't be responsible for a missed launch date or a deadline if you have been late in supplying materials or have not approved or signed off my work on-time at any stage. On top of this I will also maintain the confidentiality of any information that you give me.

I promise that I'll do my best to do right by you and anticipate any technical changes that may come up. We're humans though and sometimes something may get missed. In which case we have a sit down and figure out how we can work it out together.

##Getting down to the nitty gritty

####What I need from you

Below is a list of items I’ll need up front from you. Every project is slightly different, so there may be things I’ve missed from this list, but I will let you know as soon as I'm able if I’ve forgotten something I need.

* [LIST OF NEEDS] *includes credentials, access to any necessary services or assets, etc*

####Browser Compatibility
I have agreed to test my code in IE9+ as well as the latest releases of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. If you need browsers other than those listed tested (for instance, any browsers on mobile devices), please provide us with a list of the browsers and devices. Testing additional browsers requires more testing time as well as potentially needing to code for that specific browser.

I code everything with progressive enhancement in mind. This means that modern browsers may show slight differences from older browsers (such as text and box shadows, rounded corners, etc) based on what a browser is able to render. Any changes will not affect the user experience.

####Version Control
Git allows me to keep track of all changes that happen in your application. This way, if a bug is introduced I can quickly find where it was added and roll back to the previous bug-free state while I fix things up! I require code be under version control so I can work on your application with your employees or other contractors without worrying that we may be undoing or overwriting each others' changes.

####Changes and revisions

The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time I estimate I will need to accomplish everything you’ve told me you want to achieve, and the estimated value of the service provided, but I'm happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem as I'll provide a separate proposal for that. However, additional development needed above and beyond what I have agreed to here must be accompanied by an additional contract (which I will be happy to provide upon request), and I retain the right to refuse additional work that is not specifically outlined in this document.

####Contact
All communications will be made during regular business hours (Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm [TIME ZONE], excluding holidays) and I will return any contact requests within one business day unless I notify you ahead of time that I will be out of the office. I'm happy to speak to you on the phone, over Skype/Google Hangout, or in person if you are in the [MY CITY] area, keeping in mind that any decisions that are made will be written down and require your written approval.

####Project Management
If you do not have a preferred project management tool, I will provide you with a login for mine where you will be able to see the status of the project down to the specific task, so you will always be kept up to date. I’ll be relying on you to participate by answering my questions, stating your approval, requesting changes, and verifying completeness. I ask for a one business day turnaround time on responses so we can keep things moving along at a pace that will allow us to hit the milestones we decided on together.

####Emergencies
In the event of any emergencies occurring on a project that require attention outside of normal business hours, I will do my best to provide support, schedule permitting, but I cannot guarantee availability outside of normal working hours, and such support will be negotiated and charged for as an additional service independent of the rest of the project.

##Legal stuff

Although I test my applications, I can't guarantee that the functions contained in any application will always be error-free and so I can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate this application and any other web pages, even if you have advised me of the possibilities of such damages.

If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Phew.

####Copyrights

You guarantee to me that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide me for inclusion in the application are either owned by your good selves, or that you have permission to use them.

When I receive your final payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows:

You own the graphics and other visual elements that I create for you for this project. I will give you a copy of all files and you should store them safely as I am not required to keep them or provide any native source files that I used in making them.

You also own text content, photographs and other data you provided, unless someone else owns them. I own the code I produced and I retain the rights to license it as I choose or to contribute it back to the open source project which it is based on.

I love to show off my work and share what I have learned with other people, so I also reserve the right to display and link to your completed project as part of my portfolio and to write about the project on web sites, in magazine articles and in books as well as speak about them publicly at conferences. Of course I'm happy to keep this information to myself until your project goes live or 6 months from the handover date, whichever is sooner.

##Payments

I am sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that I send you promptly.  As I'm also sure you'll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tightly to the the payment schedule we agree upon.  Work will halt if payments are not made promptly.  Payments are only considered made when any money has cleared into my accounts (15 days for international cheques).

##Project Termination

If either party chooses to end the project, it must be done in writing.

##But where is all the horrible small print?

Just like a parking ticket, you cannot transfer this contract to anyone else without my permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of [MY STATE] courts.
